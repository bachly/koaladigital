# KoalaDigital 2-Page Website Template

This is a simple 2-page website template that can be used as your personal profile or project porfolio.
It is built with NextJS, ReactJS and TailwindCSS.

Once built, the static output files can then be **FREELY** hosted on GitHub, Netlify or SurgeSH.
The directory `out` is the root directory of the static website.

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework. That means you don't need to write CSS. Tailwind provides all the CSS classes for you
to build your page.

To modify TailwindCSS's theme, edit the file `tailwind.config.js`

To create new `tailwind.css` file in `/public/css`, run `yarn css`

## NextJS and ReactJS

- `ReactJS` is used to build out the page

- `NextJS` is used to create the static output, by running `yarn out`

## Data source

The main data source is in the `content` folder. This is loaded from 2 places:

- For development or for live server-side rendering, they are loaded by `importMd()` and `getInitialProps()`
- For HTML static output (`yarn out`), they are loaded by the `exportPathMap()` function.
- The `.md` content is loaded thanks to the `frontmatter-markdown-loader` plugin

## Common CLI

- `yarn` Install the node_modules
- `yarn dev` Develop the pages on `http://localhost:3000`
- `yarn build` Built optimised Production build
- `yarn start` Run the server and serve the Proudciton build
- `yarn out` Output into Static files in the `out` folder. Deploy the content of the `out` folder as the static websites.

## Static Hosting

- **FREE** Static hosting on GitHub, Netlify or SurgeSH, after running `yarn out` to produce the static `out` folder
- On GitHub, point the directory to `out`
- On Netlify or SurgeSH, upload the `out` folder only

## Notes

- Node version > 10 might be needed
