        <p class="measure lh-copy">
            My name is Bach. I'm a web enginner in Sydney, Australia. After working for many
            companies, from small to ASX-listed, I start up Koala Digital. Why "koala" ?
            The business idea came to me on Australia Day. While I was thinking of a business name,
            I cannot get rid of the image of a koala in my mind. It was Australia Day anyway!
