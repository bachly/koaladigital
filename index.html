                <h2>Challenge #1: Online marketing</h2>
                <p class="f4 athelas lh-copy measure">
                    Online marketing doesn't just mean a nice-looking website or an active social media site.
                    It is a journey that your customers go through from the time they <i>Discover</i> your products,
                    then <i>Develop</i> their understanding around your products and the alternatives, 
                    until finally <i>Decide</i> to make a purchase. The same journey applies to repeated customers.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 athelas lh-copy measure">
                    At Koala Digital, we will make your products easily discoverable by potential customers, by increasing
                    the products' <i>Exposure</i>. Then, we <i>Educate</i> the customers to understand more about the products and its superiority. 
                    Finally, it is just a moment away before the customers make their final purchase.
                    In this final step, we will make it as <i>Easy</i> as possible to help them execute that decision.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenge #2: Data analysis</h2>
                <p class="f4 athelas lh-copy measure">
                    Information is useful but also overwhelming. It's a challenge for business to know <i>Just Enough</i>
                    and <i>Just The Right</i> information, and also at <i>Just The Right</i> time. In order to do that, there needs
                    to be more than a single software or application that involves.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 athelas lh-copy measure">
                    Koala Digital will work with you to <i>Dissect</i> the source of information, <i>Develop</i> tools and processes
                    to make those information become useful to you, and finally <i>Decide</i> if any adjustment is needed
                    to optimise your management decision.

                    <em>Why "koala"?</em>
                    It was on Australia Day 2016 when Bach, the founder, thought of setting up the business. He couldn't get rid of
                    the image of a koala from his mind. Hence the name.</p>
                <p class="fw6 lh-title-ns">"Koalas have a relaxed lifestyle, they sleep up to 18 hours a day. Yet they are loved by everyone" - Bach said.</p>
                <p class="fw6 lh-title-ns">Therefore, Bach hopes, when people work
                    with Koala Digital, their business and lifestyle can also be transformed like that of a koala.</p>
